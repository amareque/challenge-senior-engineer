In this problem we have to syncronize two different APIs, our "local-api" and the external one.

My assumptions:
    - I'm making the assumption that source_id on the external api is set for me to tell it how to find
    the right to-do list on our "local-api"

My proposed solution for the synchronization problem is the following:
- Adding an external_id column to the to-do list table to keep track of the external id of the to-do list
- Our local api retains all the endpoints we had from the nest js interview
- Whenever we create, update or delete a to-do list, we send it to the external api via an event that gets
queued to be sent to the external api.
- For to-do lists created or updated on the external api, we use a cron job to periodically check for them
and send them to the queue to be created or updated on our local api.

A couple of things to take into consideration:
- I did not implement a retry, even if I would like to I feel like I cannot test it properly, my idea would be to
store failed events on the db and retry them exponentially

Some extra comments:
- I do not have the external api code, so I cannot test it completely.
- To run the api you just have to:
    - Run the container with
    "docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d" on the local-api directory
    - Enter the app docker with "docker exec -it nestjs-interview-app-1 bash"
    - Run "npm install if not done earlier"
    - Run "npm run start"
